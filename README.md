# Purpose of this project
The app is designed to the user (Santa Claus), who can login to the account, create the list of naughty and nice kids, check the number of presents or coals, delivered to the kids. 
So, it's made on the model of a tracker/to-do list for the end user. The app solves the problem of making a proper and easy-to-use to-do list and having all the necessary things in one place for the proper tracking and control. 
 

# Target Audience
 This project is targeted for :
- Santa
- Santaâ€™s Little Helpers
- Present thieves


# Wireframes
We used Balsamiq to create the wireframes. The final product looks a bit different from the original plans, although it was a great benefit to keep the project go properly and keep us on the track. The extended features may be implemened in the next sprints.

# Agile methodology
Throughout this project, an Agile approach was taken in order to develop the app. User Stories have different acceptance criteria. The project board, as well as the User Stories can be found in the kanban board linked [here](<https://github.com/users/Will-WHyd/projects/5/views/1>). Kanban Board has these sections: No Status, ToDo, In Progress, Done. Using the Agile approach, with clear tasks and User stories helped a lot to complete the project successfully.


# Task Management
The Kanban board not only tracked user stories but also functioned as a detailed task list. We used that to break down user stories into smaller, actionable tasks, providing clear and manageable development objectives. This approach allowed us a better progress tracking and improved collaboration within the team.
