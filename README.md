# Purpose of this project



# Target Audience
 This project is targeted for :
- Santa
- Santaâ€™s Little Helpers
- Present thieves


# Wireframes
We used Balsamiq to create the wireframes (<https://balsamiq.cloud/sfqofub/pgj5zvp/rAA7E>). The final product looks a bit different from the original plans, although it was a great benefit to keep the project go properly and keep us on the track. The extended features may be implemened in the next sprints.
